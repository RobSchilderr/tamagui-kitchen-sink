# tamagui-extras component addon for Tamagui

## ðŸ”¦ About

This repo is a mono-repo where `tamagui-extras` will be developed to add missing components and functionalities into the
UI framework `tamagui`

Many thanks to  [@FernandoTheRojo](https://twitter.com/fernandotherojo) for the Solito starter monorepo which this was
forked from. Check out
his [talk about using expo + next together at Next.js Conf 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lnbdRweJtA).

## ðŸ“¦ tamagui-extras

Fully functional [Demo](https://tamagui-extras.vercel.app/) to see all components in action.

### Installation

Install peer dependencies

```sh
# yarn add tamagui @tamagui/themes tamagui-phosphor-icons solito
# yarn add tamagui-extras
```

Follow the installation [instructions](https://tamagui.dev/docs/intro/installation) of the tamagui framework.

#### Important NextJS config

Due to external dependencies`tamagui-extras`utilizes some components which needs to be transpiled before you are able to
start.

Currently following components must be
transpiled as you can see in
the [NextJS app](https://github.com/dohomi/tamagui-kitchen-sink/blob/master/apps/next/next.config.js#L16).

Everytime you face the situation that an error message appears similar
to `SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module` you might use an node module which is not transpiled for
web.

### Components

All components are prefixed with `Lm` to have an easy identifier which component belongs to this package.

### Integration of `react-hook-form`

Form components have a trailing `Rhf` component name for an easy integration with `react-hook-form` library.

Wrap any form component with `LmFormRhfProvider` and add a `LmSubmitButtonRhf` to validate and receive all form values.

```js
import {LmFormRhfProvider, LmInputRhf, LmSliderRhf, LmSubmitButtonRhf} from "tamagui-extras/form";
import {YStack} from 'tamagui'

function MyForm() {
    const [mutate, {isLoading}] = useMutation()
    return (
        <LmFormRhfProvider>
            <YStack space>
                <LmInputRhf name={'name'} label="Name"/>
                <LmSliderRhf name={'slider'} label="Slider"/>
                <LmSubmitButtonRhf
                    onSubmit={(formData) => {
                        mutate(formData)
                    }}
                    loading={isLoading}
                >Submit
                </LmSubmitButtonRhf>
            </YStack>
        </LmFormRhfProvider>
    )
}
```

### Upgrade Guide >= 0.12

For better code split experience `tamagui-extras` only exports core components of `Tamagui`. From 0.12 onwards this is a
breaking change. All external dependency are grouped inside of folder based entry points.

Following paths are exported and should be picked from your IDE. To migrate simply remove the imports and re-import them
via your IDE.

```ts
import {LmGrid} from "tamagui";
import {LmInputRhf, LmFormRhfProvider} from "tamagui/form"; // depends on react-hook-form
import {LmLinkButton} from "tamagui/link"; // depends on solito
import {LmFile} from "tamagui/file"; // depends on expo file picker
import {LmYoutubeEmbed} from "tamagui-extras/youtube"; // depends on expo
import {LmVideo} from "tamagui-extras/video"; // depneds on expo/av
import {LmRichTextRhf} from "tamagui-extras/richText"; // depends on tiptap
import {LmDateSelectionRhf, LmDatepickerRhf} from "tamagui-extras/date"; // depends on react-hook-form
```
